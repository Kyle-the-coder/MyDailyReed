          What must I accomplish before I have my sunset moment?
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          This was the question we left open in part one while we explored
          whether or not it is out of God’s will to retire. Go back and read
          that if you haven’t. We established that there is no hard and fast
          rule regarding retirement, and using discernment and the Holy Spirit’s
          guidance will help lead us to his good, pleasing, and perfect will.
          This leaves the door open to serve others in infinitely different
          ways, not just sitting on a beach wasting away.{" "}

        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          Therefore, if it is a worthy pursuit to step away from one career and
          do a different type of paid or unpaid work, and have more time to
          delight in all the things and people you have missed, how do you know
          it is time?{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          As the question asks, “What must I accomplish?”{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          We all want to quit on top and finish well. Something makes us shudder
          at the thought of being slower, less important, outpaced by younger
          co-workers, and quietly leaving out the back door.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          There must be a way to put together one more triumph. Get back a
          previous standard of success, and show our worth in such a way that
          they will beg for us to stay, or at least cry as we walk away.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          Unfortunately, this is rarely how things play out over time in our
          careers. This is a point of huge frustration for workers as they age.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          This frustration is an opportunity for a huge amount of growth if
          looked at through the lens of the 2 halves of life.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          The first half of life is where we go get what we want and need using
          our drive and abilities. As Richard Rohr illustrates in Falling Upward
          it is the time in life where we “Build a strong container”. It’s where
          we establish an identity. In work, we gain success using our “fluid
          intelligence” – a concept brilliantly expounded on by Arthur C. Brooks
          in “From Strength to Strength”. Fluid intelligence is our ability to
          solve complex problems which helps us be productive, effective, and
          efficient. It’s how we “build the container” we work so hard to build.
          It makes us valuable.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          And then, we encounter the second half of life. It finds us even if we
          are not looking for it, and even if we are running from it. Rohr says
          it’s where we “Find the contents the container is meant to hold. “
          Brooks puts it in terms of us moving on from “fluid intelligence” to
          “crystallized intelligence “ which is gained through learning and
          experience. It makes us invaluable.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          When you are young, you have raw smarts; when you are old, you have
          wisdom. When you are young, you can generate lots of facts; when you
          are old, you know what they mean and how to use them.
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          Arthur C. Brooks, From Strength to Strength: Finding Success,
          Happiness, and Deep Purpose in the Second Half of Life
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          The problem lies in our inability to recognize and take the journey
          into the second half.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          If we are stuck in believing we have to build an identity, be wildly
          productive, and strive to establish what has already been established
          we will be stuck.{" "}
        </p>

          You can’t be perpetually “Up and Coming “!{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          Back to our question “What must I accomplish before I have my sunset
          moment? “{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          It’s not another promotion or accolade. It’s embracing the wisdom you
          have gained, giving up the desire to be the go-to guy or girl, and
          pouring into the ones who will replace you, that will be most
          rewarding as retirement approaches. This is where you fill the
          container you built.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="outfit-thin-font">
          The high point of your career will probably come somewhere in the
          middle. Embrace that, be thankful for it, and move joyfully toward
          that sunset moment. And don’t look back to see who’s crying.{" "}
