          My Daily Reed. When you read and respond, in any way, itâ€™s an
          inexplicable connection. PLEASE share your thoughts. The space between
          a writer and the reader is sacred. Because there are only so many
          heartbeats and pen strokes we can share in this life. What we share
          should be thought-provoking, meaningful, and dare I say. FUN!
